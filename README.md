th_s (THUNDERSCORES)
===

Hi! I'm a set of Sass files called `th_s` or `THUNDERSCORES` meant to be used within the [_s](http://underscores.me/ "So good!") WordPress starter theme, but you could easily repurpose it for pretty much whatever you want. Pretty much.

Some cool stuff about it:
* For now it requires Sass v3.3.0 Maptastic Maple or newer (BECAUSE MAPS!).
* All your files are super duper organized via Atomic folder structure.
* Mixins, extends, functions, and variable files are grouped with related modules. This makes your code a bit more maintainable later down the road.
* It's got some generated editor styles! Time-saver.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

Getting Started
---------------

The simplest way to get going is to download `th_s` from Github. Then head over to http://underscores.me to generate your `_s`-based theme. Follow these steps to combine them:

1. Move the contents of `th_s` into yout newly generated theme directory.
2. Then, update the comment block in `style.scss` to reflect your new theme.
3. You can process the files using your favorite compiler. CodeKit and Grunt are my personal favorites.
4. Update or delete this readme.

### Using Grunt
Make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Here's a handy installer for Windows, Mac, and Linux:
http://nodejs.org/download/

Once that has installed, you'll need to install the node dependencies. Run this from your theme folder:

`npm install`

Then run `grunt` to start watching and compiling your CSS files.

You may also have to install Sass. It's as easy as running `gem install sass`.


### Cool. Coolcoolcool.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
